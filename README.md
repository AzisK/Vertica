# Run Vertica locally on Docker

Simply start the Vertica CE container by `docker-compose up` using the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in this repo. Login credentials can be seen in the same file. Have fun innovating!

Feel free to change the version of the Vertica Docker image. More information can be found on the Vertica DockerHub registry.
